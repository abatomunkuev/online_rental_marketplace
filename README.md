# Web Project: Online rental marketplace

The project is a college project (Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology) was done entirely by me. The duration of the project was one semester.

In this project, I have demonstrated a high level of knowledge:
-	front-end: HTML, CSS, ES6 JavaScript, design in Figma, animations (GSAP) 
-	back-end: Node JS, express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose – database, server-side rendering – handlebars.js, security – encrypting and validating login and passwords (bcrypt.js) as well as generating unique authentication tokens (jsonwebtokens), confirming booking – sending a confirmation email. 
-	GIT – source version control. I have been updating the project for the whole semester by using git and github. 

Created a design prototype in Figma, based on the prototype made responsive web pages using media queries. Added user-friendly features: dynamic map, filtering rental posts using 3rd party libraries and API’s. The most exciting and difficult task was to build a dynamic map of the rentals using third-party API "geocoder" and leaflet.js library.
